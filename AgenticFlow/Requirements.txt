# Agentic Flow Requirements

## 1. Overview
A unified workspace for Ideation, Planning, and Solutioning that replaces the traditional tabbed workflow with a 4-pane "Agentic Interface". The core philosophy is to separate "Clarification/Reasoning" from "Data Generation/Commitment".

## 2. Layout Structure (4 Panes)
The screen is divided into 3 vertical columns (side-by-side) and 1 bottom pane.

### A. Left Bar (Thin) - "Items & Concepts"
- **Content:** List of Project Items and Concepts.
- **Display:** Name, Short Description, Type, Status.
- **Interaction:**
  - Multi-select capability (Select one, multiple, or "All Project").
  - Selection determines the "Context" for the chat and the Right Window.

### B. Main Chat Window (Middle) - "Clarification & Suggestions"
- **Actor:** Agent 1 (The Clarifier).
- **Behavior:**
  - Asks exactly 3 clarification questions per turn.
  - Provides exactly 3 suggestions/materials/solutions per turn.
  - Waits for user response before proceeding.
- **Input:** Standard chat bar.

### C. Right Window (Right) - "Current State / Knowledge Base"
- **Actor:** Agent 2 (The Summarizer).
- **Content:** A live, editable text document representing everything the AI knows about the selected context (Project or specific Items).
- **Behavior:**
  - Updates automatically after every chat turn.
  - Structured format (Markdown).
  - **Editable:** User can manually edit/delete text here. The Agent must respect these manual edits in the next turn.

### D. Bottom Pane (Full Width) - "Structured Item Editor"
- **Actor:** Agent 3 (The Generator).
- **Visibility:** Visible when specific items are selected.
- **Content:** The actual database fields for the item (as currently seen in the Solutioning tab).
  - Fields: Description, Type, Status, Steps, Materials, Tools.
- **Action:** "Turn into Item/Concept" button.
  - When clicked, Agent 3 takes the text from the Right Window and parses it to fill/update these structured fields.

## 3. Agent Roles & Workflow
1.  **The Clarifier:** Drives the conversation. Ensures missing data is gathered via questions.
2.  **The Summarizer:** Maintains the "Mental Model" in the Right Window. It does NOT update the database items directly, only the text summary.
3.  **The Generator:** The "Commit" agent. Triggered manually. Converts the unstructured "Mental Model" (Right Window) into structured Database records (Bottom Pane).

## 4. Modes
1.  **Clarification Mode:** Chatting, reasoning, updating the text summary.
2.  **Generation Mode:** Committing the summary to actual Item data.
